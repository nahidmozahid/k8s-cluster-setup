#Check IPv6 Binding Behavior

cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/bindv6only

>> 0 ➜ Dual binding is enabled (should accept IPv4)

1 ➜ IPv6-only binding (this is your problem)


#Why is the Master Node NotReady?

The most common reasons:

    ✅ Network Plugin Not Working or Not Fully Applied (Most likely in your case)

    ❌ Swap not disabled

    ❌ kubelet not healthy

    ❌ Missing container runtime or not properly connected

    ❌ Firewall blocking communication
    

#Check If Network Plugin Is Deployed
Make sure kube-flannel is running on both master and worker nodes as we deployed flannel for network plugin. If it’s not running, reapply Flannel:

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flannel-io/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml

#Disable Swap (If Not Already) On both master and worker nodes:

swapoff -a
nano /etc/fstab

Comment out any line that has swap.

#sudo systemctl status kubelet (make sure it's active and running)

sudo systemctl status kubelet

#Check if containerd is running:

sudo systemctl status containerd

#Verify Network Ports On both master and worker:

sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 6443
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 10250

>> ✅ Port 6443 (API server) should be listening.
✅ Port 10250 (kubelet) should be listening.

#Check Cluster Events On the master node:

kubectl describe node k8s-master
kubectl get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'

#Quick command summary:

kubectl get pods -A -o wide
kubectl describe node k8s-master
kubectl get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
sudo systemctl status kubelet
sudo systemctl status containerd
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 6443
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 10250
